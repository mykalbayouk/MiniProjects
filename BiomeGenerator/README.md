# BiomeGenerator
This mini project of mine is to develop a bio generator using cellular automata. As of now I have a basic idea of how it works but in the future
the goal is to be able to add many more possible assests and get them to interact with each other. 

# Future goals:
* Be able to use a hydration/elevation map in order to create a biome
* Use this sort of algorithm for planetary automation creation 
* Get visuals linked to the different assets 

# How to use

To run the file:
```
make run
```

To clean the workspace:

``` 
make clean
```
